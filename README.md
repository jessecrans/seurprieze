## User Auth Template
This is a template for a website with already set up user authentication. It has a user profile where username and password can be changed. Users can also sign in with Google.

To make a new website with this template, first register a new app with firebase and allow for email/password and google authentication. Then put the necessary api keys into a .env file, see *firebase.ts* for the key names.
